The goal of this project was to create an effective classifier that determines the presence of metastatic cancer in pathology scans.

I used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train/test on nearly 300k images of dimensions 96x96x3. Following data wrangling, EDA, hyperparametertuning, and design of the CNN architecture, the results is a classifier that consistently performed above 90% accuracy and 0.95 AUC on testing data.
