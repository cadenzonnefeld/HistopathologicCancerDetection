Goal of this project to create an effective classifier that determines the presence of metastatic cancer in pathology scans.

I used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train/test on nearly 300k images of dimensions 96x96x3. Following some hyperparametertuning and altering of the CNN architecture, the results is a classifier that consistently performed above 90% accuracy and 0.95 AUC on testing data.
